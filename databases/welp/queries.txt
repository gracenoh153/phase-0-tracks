2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

command:
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN users ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id; 

output: 
1|2|THIS BLOWS|1|1|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel
2|5|THIS rockS|2|2|2|Holly|Berry|2|Lotus Yoga
3|4.5|Delicious! BEST SUSHI EVARRRR|3|3|3|Denzel|George|3|Sushi World

3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;  

output: 
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|THIS BLOWS
Holly|Berry|Lotus Yoga|5|THIS rockS
Denzel|George|Sushi World|4.5|Delicious! BEST SUSHI EVARRRR

4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

command:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN businesses ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id WHERE business_id = 3;

output:
Denzel|George|Sushi World|4.5|Delicious! BEST SUSHI EVARRRR
