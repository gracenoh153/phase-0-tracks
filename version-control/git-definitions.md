# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control lets us see the changes made on one (or more) files by one (or more) people, then lets us combine those different files into one version. Developers use it for when multiple people have to work on the same file or project, so that they can work on it on their own time, on their own computers. Also, because it keeps a record of each change by each person, you can choose which changes to keep or merge into your final project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch makes a copy of your file/project, so that the original copy remains unchanged. You can then make whatever changes you wish within the branch, and then choose to discard or merge your new changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point within Git. Commit messages should be descriptive (and preferably concise) so that you (or other developers) know exactly what kinds of changes were saved.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when contradicting changes are made to the same line of a particular file, or if the file that needs to be edited has already been deleted.
