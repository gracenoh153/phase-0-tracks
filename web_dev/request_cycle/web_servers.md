Release 1, question 2
** What is a VPS, and what are its advantages? **
    * A VPS is a "computer", without the hardware. It can store memory, and operates as its own being, with its own files. Basically, a virtual version of a physical computer. It also allows the user to access the virtual server from their own local machine, changing and accessing the files as they see fit.
    * Advantages include:
        - more affordable than physical server
        - features are customizable, therefore allowing user to pay for only what they need
        - plans can be purchased and updated as needed (i.e. as your business grows, you can add more features and increase the plan as you see fit)
        - user has more control with VPS versus shared hosting
        - pretty much the same amount of tech support as you would with shared hosting 
        - can choose to have a hosting service where the web host has partial control over maintenance and other services
